To import Database , you have to create first a database called "gamestore" and then you can import the "gamestore.sql"
file and proceed to the Website.

The first page of the website is the "Home.php" page , copy the "GaMode Project" folder from the .zip file to the "htdocs" folder 
if you're using Xampp and then open your Chrome browser and search in the address "localhost/GaMode Project/Home.php"
to access Home page

We used Google Chrome as a browser to display the project and on one screen size so you might find some problems in 
case you're using different browsers or screen sizes. 

You can try to zoom out in case the screen is too big since we didn't implement constraints for different screen sizes.
